### EEG signal prediction by python
#### Sleep staging
By examining an individual's EEG and other physiological signs, sleep staging can determine the stage of sleep they are now experiencing.
#### Traditional sleep recordings are split into 30-second windows, and each window is assigned to one of five categories (or "stages"):


1. W: alertness
2. N1: a brief nap
3. N2: longer slumber
4. N3: sound asleep
5. R: fast eye movement

The majority of the time, sleep staging relies on collecting changes in the EEG's spectral features as well as transient events (such as sleep spindles, 
k-complexes, slow waves, etc.) that happen during the various stages of sleep.
