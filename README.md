Sleep staging
By examining an individual's EEG and other physiological signs, sleep staging can determine the stage of sleep they are now experiencing.
Traditional sleep recordings are split into 30-second windows, and each window is assigned to one of five categories (or "stages"):


W: alertness
N1: a brief nap
N2: longer slumber
N3: sound asleep
R: fast eye movement
The majority of the time, sleep staging relies on collecting changes in the EEG's spectral features as well as transient events (such as sleep spindles, 
k-complexes, slow waves, etc.) that happen during the various stages of sleep.
